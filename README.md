<h2 align="center">versions</h2>
<p>In this repository is a bunch of .info files (text files) with seemingly random numbers inside. These are versions numbers that I can easily update meaning with a little bit of magic (losing brain cells when programming) I can make each project of mine check if a newer version is available!</p>
